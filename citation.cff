abstract: >-
  Calcium (Ca2+) elevation is an essential secondary
  messenger in many cellular processes, including
  disease progression and adaptation to external
  stimuli, e.g., gravitational load. Therefore,
  mapping and quantifying Ca2+ signaling with a high
  spatiotemporal resolution is a key challenge.
  However, particularly on microgravity platforms,
  experiment time is limited, allowing only a small
  number of replicates. Furthermore, experiment
  hardware is exposed to changes in gravity levels,
  causing experimental artifacts unless appropriately
  controlled. We introduce a new experimental setup
  based on the fluorescent Ca2+ reporter CaMPARI2,
  onboard LED arrays, and subsequent microscopic
  analysis on the ground. This setup allows for
  higher throughput and accuracy due to its
  retrograde nature. The excellent performance of
  CaMPARI2 was demonstrated with human chondrocytes
  during the 75th ESA parabolic flight campaign.
  CaMPARI2 revealed a strong Ca2+ response triggered
  by histamine but was not affected by the
  alternating gravitational load of a parabolic
  flight.
